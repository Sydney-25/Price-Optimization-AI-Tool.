## Overview

The AI-Powered Price Optimization Tool is designed to help businesses make data-driven pricing decisions. By uploading historical sales data in CSV format, the application:
- Processes and prepares the data using a dedicated data processor.
- Trains a predictive model to evaluate the impact of different pricing strategies.
- Provides an optimized price recommendation along with an estimate of expected revenue.
- Visualizes key aspects of the pricing strategy including price optimization and competition analysis.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Easily upload your historical sales data (CSV format).
- **Data Processing**: Automatically loads and prepares features for model training.
- **Machine Learning**: Trains and evaluates a model to predict optimal pricing.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Generates plots to visualize both the price optimization curve and competition analysis.
- **Downloadable Files**: Download the essential project files (e.g., `main.py` and `README.md`) as a ZIP archive directly from the app.
- **Custom Styling**: Custom CSS is loaded to enhance the user interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/price-optimization-tool.git
    cd price-optimization-tool
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Ensure that you have installed the following libraries:
   - Streamlit
   - Pandas
   - NumPy
   - Plotly (for visualization)
   
   Additional modules (e.g., in the `models` and `utils` directories) should be present in the repository.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run price.py
    ```

2. **Upload Your Data**:
   - Use the file uploader in the application to select your historical sales data (CSV file).

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Once the CSV file is uploaded, the application processes the data, trains the model, and evaluates its accuracy.
   - A success message is displayed upon successful model training along with the model's evaluation score.

4. **Price Optimization**:
   - Enter the current price, competition price, and define the minimum and maximum price boundaries.
   - Click the **Optimize Price** button to calculate the optimal pricing strategy.
   - The application displays the optimal price, the estimated revenue, and visualizes the results using interactive plots.

5. **Download Project Files**:
   - A sidebar option allows you to download a ZIP file containing key project files such as `main.py` and this `README.md`.

## Project Structure

```
price-optimization-tool/
├── main.py              # Main application file for running the Streamlit app
├── price.py             # Price optimization application (Streamlit app)
├── README.md            # Project documentation (this file)
├── requirements.txt     # List of Python dependencies
├── styles/
│   └── style.css        # Custom CSS styles for the app
├── models/

└── utils/
    ├── data_processor.py   # Handles data loading, processing, and feature preparation
    └── visualization.py    # Generates interactive plots for optimization results
```

Ensure the directory structure is maintained so that the modules can be correctly imported.

## Customization

- **Styling**: Modify `styles/style.css` to change the visual appearance of the application.
- **Model & Data Processing**: Update the `models/price_optimizer.py` and `utils/data_processor.py` files to enhance or adjust the data processing and pricing logic.
- **Visualizations**: Customize the plots by editing `utils/visualization.py` to better suit your specific needs.
